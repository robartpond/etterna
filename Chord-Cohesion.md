##  What is Chord Cohesion


Chord cohesion refers to the system used by SM5 to register note judgements for notes with more than 1 arrow(Be it jumps, hands, quads, etc). What it does is simply take the timing for the last arrow hit, and use that timing for the whole note.
Disabling note cohesion means that each arrow has it's own judgement.
