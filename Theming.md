##  What is a Theme?

Stepmania is basically the base engine of the game. You can think of a theme as a "skin" for the game which changes how it looks, while remaining more or less the same game. But themes can be very powerful, and have very interesting features that are completely theme-dependant(Like 'Til Death's customizable Gameplay feature).
