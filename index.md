## What Is Etterna?

Etterna is a rhythm game based on the Stepmania engine that is focused on better accomodating the four-key keyboard metagame. Some new features include automatic difficulty calculation, a new scoring system, and engine optimizations. Etterna is generally compatible with content for stepmania 5.0. However, some Stepmania 5.0 themes may require modification in order to function properly.
